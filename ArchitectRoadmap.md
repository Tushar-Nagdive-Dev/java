# üõ†Ô∏è Developer ‚Üí Architect Roadmap (Tushar‚Äôs Path)

## **Phase 1: Foundation Strengthening (Months 0‚Äì3)**

**Goal**: Master Java fundamentals, OOP, and problem-solving (DSA) so you can design reliable building blocks.

### Skills to Cover

* **Java (Core ‚Üí Advanced)**

    * OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
    * Java 8+ (Streams, Lambdas, Functional Interfaces, Optional)
    * Collections Framework (HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap, etc.)
    * Multithreading (Executors, CompletableFuture, Locks, Parallel Streams)
    * Memory Management & Garbage Collection

* **DSA with Java**

    * Arrays, Strings, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues
    * Hashing, Recursion, Sorting, Searching
    * Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming (intermediate level for system design)

### Deliverables

* Build a **mini OOP project** (Library/Banking System).
* Solve **100 DSA problems** (LeetCode/Codeforces/InterviewBit).

---

## **Phase 2: Spring Boot & Backend Engineering (Months 3‚Äì6)**

**Goal**: Move from coding ‚Üí building real-world, production-ready applications.

### Skills to Cover

* **Spring Boot Deep Dive**

    * REST APIs (validation, exception handling, filters)
    * Spring Data JPA + Hibernate (performance tuning, query optimization)
    * Spring Security (JWT, OAuth2, Role-based access, Keycloak basics)
    * Logging, Monitoring (Logback, ELK stack, Micrometer, Actuator)
    * Event-driven systems (Kafka basics)

* **Database Mastery**

    * PostgreSQL/MySQL advanced queries, indexing, normalization/denormalization
    * Transactions, isolation levels, locks

### Deliverables

* Build a **User Auth & Role-based Access microservice** with JWT + Spring Security.
* Implement a **Kafka event-driven flow** (order ‚Üí payment ‚Üí notification).

---

## **Phase 3: System Design Foundations (Months 6‚Äì9)**

**Goal**: Start thinking like an architect ‚Äî design scalable, reliable systems.

### Skills to Cover

* **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

    * Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer, etc.)
    * UML diagrams, C4 diagrams

* **High-Level Design (HLD)**

    * Monolith vs Microservices vs Serverless
    * Scalability: Load balancing, caching, database sharding, replication
    * Communication: REST, gRPC, messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
    * Resilience: Circuit breaker, retries, fallbacks

### Deliverables

* Design **2‚Äì3 system design case studies** (e.g., WhatsApp chat system, YouTube video platform, Uber ride-hailing system).
* Document trade-offs (availability vs consistency, SQL vs NoSQL).

---

## **Phase 4: Cloud & DevOps Mastery (Months 9‚Äì12)**

**Goal**: Architect systems that scale on cloud.

### Skills to Cover

* **AWS (start with core services)**

    * Compute: EC2, ECS/EKS, Lambda
    * Storage: S3, EBS, DynamoDB, RDS
    * Networking: VPC, API Gateway, Load Balancers
    * Monitoring: CloudWatch, IAM, Secrets Manager

* **DevOps**

    * Docker & Kubernetes (basics ‚Üí deployments)
    * CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
    * Infrastructure as Code (Terraform basics)

### Deliverables

* Deploy your Spring Boot + Angular project on AWS (end-to-end).
* Create CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments.

---

## **Phase 5: Architect Thinking & Leadership (Months 12‚Äì18)**

**Goal**: Transition from **developer** ‚Üí **decision maker**.

### Skills to Cover

* **Enterprise Patterns**

    * CQRS, Event Sourcing, Saga Pattern
    * Hexagonal/Onion/Clean Architecture
    * API Gateway, Service Mesh (Istio, Consul)

* **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

    * Availability, Scalability, Maintainability, Security, Observability

* **Leadership Skills**

    * Code reviews, mentoring juniors
    * Writing ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)
    * Communicating architecture to stakeholders

### Deliverables

* Architect a **real-world project** (e.g., AI-Links, FlowMatch) with complete HLD + LLD + cloud deployment.
* Mentor at least 1‚Äì2 developers in your team.
