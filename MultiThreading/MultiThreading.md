## 🧠 **1. What Is a Thread (in Real Terms)?**

A **thread** is the smallest independent unit of execution within a program.
It’s like a **worker** inside your process — sharing the same memory but doing tasks independently.

💡 **Analogy:**
Imagine your Spring Boot service as a restaurant 🏢.

* The **process** = the restaurant itself (with shared kitchen, tables, and stock).
* Each **thread** = a waiter serving one customer independently.
  They all share the same space but handle different requests simultaneously.

---

## ⚙️ **2. Process vs Thread**

| Concept            | Process                                 | Thread                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory**         | Has its own memory                      | Shares memory with other threads            |
| **Communication**  | Inter-Process Communication (slow)      | Shared memory (fast, but risk of conflicts) |
| **Failure Impact** | One process crash doesn’t affect others | One bad thread can crash the process        |
| **Example**        | Chrome tabs (each tab = process)        | Each tab’s background scripts = threads     |

---

## 🧩 **3. Thread Lifecycle (States in JVM)**

A thread goes through **5 states** during its lifecycle:

| State                 | Description                    | Trigger                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **NEW**               | Thread created but not started | `new Thread()`                          |
| **RUNNABLE**          | Ready to run or running        | `thread.start()`                        |
| **BLOCKED / WAITING** | Waiting for lock/resource      | `wait()`, `sleep()`, or lock contention |
| **TIMED_WAITING**     | Waiting with timeout           | `sleep(1000)`, `wait(5000)`             |
| **TERMINATED**        | Execution completed            | Thread finishes `run()`                 |

🧩 **Visual Flow:**

```
NEW → RUNNABLE → WAITING/BLOCKED → RUNNABLE → TERMINATED
```

---

## 🔨 **4. Creating Threads (3 Primary Ways)**

### ✅ **1. Extending `Thread` class**

```java
class EmailThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Sending email in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadExample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EmailThread emailThread = new EmailThread();
        emailThread.start();  // start() → creates a new call stack
    }
}
```

🧩 **Key Points:**

* `start()` creates a new thread and calls `run()` internally.
* If you call `run()` directly → it runs in the **main thread** (no concurrency).

---

### ✅ **2. Implementing `Runnable` Interface**

```java
class EmailTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Processing email in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadExample2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new EmailTask());
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

🧩 **Advantages:**

* Better for **reusability** and **inheritance** (since you’re not forced to extend Thread).
* Often used in **ExecutorService**.

---

### ✅ **3. Using `Callable` with `Future` (Return Value + Exception Handling)**

`Runnable` can’t return results or throw checked exceptions.
`Callable<V>` can — it returns a value and can throw exceptions.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadExample3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        Callable<String> task = () -> {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            return "Email sent successfully by " + Thread.currentThread().getName();
        };

        Future<String> result = executor.submit(task);

        System.out.println("Main thread doing other work...");
        System.out.println("Result: " + result.get()); // blocks until result is ready

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

🧩 **Key Points:**

* `submit()` accepts a `Callable` or `Runnable`.
* `Future.get()` blocks until the task completes.
* Used in enterprise async workflows (e.g., background data fetchers).

---

## 🧠 **5. Runnable vs Callable vs Future**

| Feature      | Runnable               | Callable                | Future                |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Return value | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                   | ✅ Holds result        |
| Exception    | ❌ Unchecked only       | ✅ Checked allowed       | ✅ Can get via `get()` |
| Used with    | Thread / Executor      | ExecutorService         | ExecutorService       |
| Example use  | Logging, notifications | Computations, API calls | Manage results        |

---

## 💼 **6. Real-World Example (E-commerce Order Processing)**

Imagine SmartMart processes an order:

1. One thread verifies stock.
2. Another thread handles payment.
3. Another sends the confirmation email.

These run **concurrently** for better throughput.

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

Callable<Boolean> stockTask = () -> { /* check stock */ return true; };
Callable<Boolean> paymentTask = () -> { /* process payment */ return true; };
Callable<String> emailTask = () -> { /* send email */ return "Email sent"; };

Future<Boolean> stock = pool.submit(stockTask);
Future<Boolean> payment = pool.submit(paymentTask);
Future<String> email = pool.submit(emailTask);

if (stock.get() && payment.get()) {
    System.out.println(email.get());
}

pool.shutdown();
```

👉 This is the **foundation** of async workflows in backend systems — later, you’ll see how this pattern evolves into **CompletableFuture** and **Reactive APIs**.

---

## ⚡ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Calling `run()` directly (no concurrency)
* ❌ Forgetting `executor.shutdown()`
* ❌ Using too many threads manually (risk: OOM or CPU starvation)
* ❌ Ignoring exceptions in background threads (use try-catch inside `run()`)

---

## ✅ **Next Lesson: Synchronization & Thread Safety**

We’ll go deep into:

* Race conditions
* `synchronized`, `volatile`
* `ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`
* Atomic variables
* Real-world: concurrent balance update in a banking app

---

## 💼 Mini Project: **BankX — Concurrent Transaction Processor**

### 🧠 Scenario

You’re designing **BankX**, a lightweight system where multiple customers deposit and withdraw money *simultaneously*.
We’ll simulate concurrent transactions using:

* Multiple **threads** for users performing deposits/withdrawals
* A shared **account balance**
* `Runnable` and `Callable` tasks to show both **fire-and-forget** and **result-based** concurrency.

This will naturally prepare us for our **next lesson** on synchronization and thread safety — because this project will deliberately cause a **race condition** that we’ll fix later. 💥

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Project Setup

Package:

```
com.bankx.concurrent
```

File:

```
BankTransactionSimulator.java
```

---

## 🧮 Step 2: Code Implementation

```java
package com.bankx.concurrent;

import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class BankTransactionSimulator {

    // Shared bank account balance
    private static double accountBalance = 1000.0;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        System.out.println("🏦 Initial Balance: " + accountBalance);

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

        // Runnable: deposit money (fire and forget)
        Runnable depositTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                double amount = 100.0;
                accountBalance += amount;
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " deposited ₹" + amount +
                                   " → New Balance: " + accountBalance);
                try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
            }
        };

        // Runnable: withdraw money (fire and forget)
        Runnable withdrawTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                double amount = 80.0;
                accountBalance -= amount;
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " withdrew ₹" + amount +
                                   " → New Balance: " + accountBalance);
                try { Thread.sleep(400); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
            }
        };

        // Callable: check final balance (returns result)
        Callable<Double> balanceCheckTask = () -> {
            Thread.sleep(1500);
            return accountBalance;
        };

        // Submit tasks
        executor.submit(depositTask);
        executor.submit(depositTask);
        executor.submit(withdrawTask);
        Future<Double> futureBalance = executor.submit(balanceCheckTask);

        System.out.println("🔁 Processing transactions concurrently...");

        // Get result from Callable
        Double finalBalance = futureBalance.get();
        System.out.println("💰 Final Balance (might be incorrect): ₹" + finalBalance);

        executor.shutdown();
        System.out.println("✅ All transactions completed.");
    }
}
```

---

### 🧠 **Expected Sample Output**

(You’ll see interleaving depending on CPU scheduling)

```
🏦 Initial Balance: 1000.0
🔁 Processing transactions concurrently...
pool-1-thread-1 deposited ₹100.0 → New Balance: 1100.0
pool-1-thread-2 withdrew ₹80.0 → New Balance: 1020.0
pool-1-thread-3 deposited ₹100.0 → New Balance: 1120.0
pool-1-thread-1 withdrew ₹80.0 → New Balance: 1040.0
pool-1-thread-2 deposited ₹100.0 → New Balance: 1140.0
pool-1-thread-3 withdrew ₹80.0 → New Balance: 1060.0
💰 Final Balance (might be incorrect): ₹1060.0
✅ All transactions completed.
```

⚠️ **But wait — sometimes the final balance won’t match the expected result!**
That’s because multiple threads are modifying `accountBalance` **without synchronization** → a **race condition** occurs. 🧨

And *that’s* exactly what we’ll fix in the next lesson.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways from This Exercise

| Concept                  | Explanation                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared Resource**      | `accountBalance` is accessed by multiple threads — unsafe.                                        |
| **Race Condition**       | Two threads update the same variable simultaneously — last one wins.                              |
| **Runnable vs Callable** | Deposits/withdrawals = `Runnable` (fire-and-forget), balance check = `Callable` (returns result). |
| **ExecutorService**      | Manages thread lifecycle efficiently — real enterprise pattern.                                   |
| **Problem Preview**      | Thread safety & synchronization required to ensure consistency.                                   |

---

### 💪 Optional Challenge

Add 5 more customers and introduce random transaction amounts using:

```java
ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextDouble(50, 150);
```

Then run it multiple times — you’ll *see different results every time!*
That’s non-deterministic thread behavior — perfect setup for synchronization.

---

# Lesson 2 — Synchronization & Thread Safety (BankX)

## 0) Why the previous code was unsafe

`accountBalance += amount;` is **not atomic**. It’s at least three steps (read → add → write). Two threads interleave and **lose updates**.

> Key rule: If multiple threads read/write the **same mutable state**, you need **coordination** (locks/atomics).

---

## 1) `synchronized`: the simplest, correct first step

### 1.1 Intrinsic lock on the account object

Create a **thread-safe** `BankAccount` and use **BigDecimal** for money (never `double` for real currency).

```java
package com.bankx.concurrent;

import java.math.BigDecimal;

public class BankAccount {
    private BigDecimal balance = new BigDecimal("1000.00");

    // Entire method is synchronized (intrinsic lock = this)
    public synchronized void deposit(BigDecimal amount) {
        balance = balance.add(amount);
    }

    public synchronized void withdraw(BigDecimal amount) {
        // example business rule
        if (balance.compareTo(amount) < 0) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Insufficient funds");
        }
        balance = balance.subtract(amount);
    }

    public synchronized BigDecimal getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### 1.2 Using it in the simulator

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();

Runnable depositor = () -> {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        account.deposit(new BigDecimal("100.00"));
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " deposited → " + account.getBalance());
        sleep(300);
    }
};

Runnable withdrawer = () -> {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        try {
            account.withdraw(new BigDecimal("80.00"));
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " withdrew → " + account.getBalance());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Withdraw failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        sleep(250);
    }
};

pool.submit(depositor);
pool.submit(depositor);
pool.submit(withdrawer);

pool.shutdown();
```

**Takeaways**

* `synchronized` ensures **mutual exclusion** and **visibility** (happens-before).
* It’s **reentrant** (a thread can re-acquire the same lock).
* Keep critical sections **small** (lock only around shared state).

---

## 2) `synchronized` block for finer granularity

If the method has non-critical work (logging, validation), lock **only** the balance mutation:

```java
public void deposit(BigDecimal amount) {
    validate(amount);
    synchronized (this) {
        balance = balance.add(amount);
    }
    audit("deposit", amount);
}
```

---

## 3) `ReentrantLock`: more control than `synchronized`

Use when you need **tryLock**, **timeout**, **fairness**, or **multiple condition variables**.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;

public class BankAccountLocking {
    private BigDecimal balance = new BigDecimal("1000.00");
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fair lock

    public void deposit(BigDecimal amount) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            balance = balance.add(amount);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount) {
        boolean acquired = false;
        try {
            acquired = lock.tryLock(); // or tryLock(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
            if (!acquired) throw new IllegalStateException("System busy, try again");
            if (balance.compareTo(amount) < 0) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Insufficient funds");
            }
            balance = balance.subtract(amount);
        } finally {
            if (acquired) lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public BigDecimal getBalance() {
        lock.lock();
        try { return balance; } finally { lock.unlock(); }
    }
}
```

**When to prefer `ReentrantLock`**

* You need **non-blocking attempts** (`tryLock`).
* You must avoid **priority inversion** or favor fairness.
* You need **multiple conditions** (e.g., `notEmpty`, `notFull`).

---

## 4) Read-heavy patterns: `ReadWriteLock`

For scenarios with many readers and few writers:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.*;

public class BankLedger {
    private BigDecimal balance = new BigDecimal("1000.00");
    private final ReadWriteLock rw = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final Lock r = rw.readLock();
    private final Lock w = rw.writeLock();

    public void deposit(BigDecimal amount) { w.lock(); try { balance = balance.add(amount); } finally { w.unlock(); } }
    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount) { w.lock(); try { balance = balance.subtract(amount); } finally { w.unlock(); } }
    public BigDecimal getBalance() { r.lock(); try { return balance; } finally { r.unlock(); } }
}
```

---

## 5) Atomics (`Atomic*`, `LongAdder`) — when they fit

* Great for **counters**, **stats**, and **high-contention increments**.
* Not ideal for **composed operations** (check-then-act) without extra coordination.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

public class Metrics {
    private final AtomicLong successfulTx = new AtomicLong();
    private final AtomicLong failedTx = new AtomicLong();

    public void markSuccess() { successfulTx.incrementAndGet(); }
    public void markFail() { failedTx.incrementAndGet(); }
    public long successes() { return successfulTx.get(); }
}
```

> For extreme contention, prefer `LongAdder` over `AtomicLong` (better under high write concurrency).

---

## 6) Why `volatile` is **not** a lock

* `volatile` gives **visibility**, not **atomicity**.
* `volatile int x; x++` is **not safe**.
* Use it for flags (e.g., `volatile boolean running`) or to publish immutable objects safely.

```java
private volatile boolean running = true;

public void stop() { running = false; }
public void loop() {
  while (running) { /* work */ }
}
```

---

## 7) Avoiding deadlocks (must-know for architects)

**Deadlock conditions**: mutual exclusion, hold-and-wait, no preemption, circular wait.

**Prevention strategy (simple & effective):** **Global lock ordering**
Always acquire locks in the same **global order** across the codebase.

```java
// Always lock account A before account B if A.id < B.id
public void transfer(Account from, Account to, BigDecimal amt) {
    Account first = from.id() < to.id() ? from : to;
    Account second = from.id() < to.id() ? to : from;

    synchronized (first) {
        synchronized (second) {
            from.withdraw(amt);
            to.deposit(amt);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 8) Production checklist (Architect mindset)

* Keep shared state **small** and **well-encapsulated**.
* Prefer **immutability** wherever possible.
* Keep lock hold-time **short**; avoid I/O inside locks.
* Expose **thread-safe APIs**; hide internals.
* Monitor with **JFR**, **thread dumps**, **metrics** (queue sizes, pool saturation).
* In Spring, prefer **stateless services** + delegate to **thread-safe repositories/services**.

---

## 9) Upgraded BankX: Thread-safe version (complete)

```java
package com.bankx.concurrent;

import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class BankXApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(6);
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(); // synchronized methods

        Runnable depositor = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                account.deposit(new BigDecimal("100.00"));
                log("deposit", account.getBalance());
                sleep(150);
            }
        };

        Runnable withdrawer = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                try {
                    account.withdraw(new BigDecimal("80.00"));
                    log("withdraw", account.getBalance());
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    System.out.println("Withdraw failed: " + e.getMessage());
                }
                sleep(120);
            }
        };

        Callable<BigDecimal> balanceCheck = account::getBalance;

        pool.submit(depositor);
        pool.submit(depositor);
        pool.submit(withdrawer);
        pool.submit(withdrawer);

        Future<BigDecimal> finalBal = pool.submit(balanceCheck);

        pool.shutdown();
        pool.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        System.out.println("✅ Final Balance: ₹" + finalBal.get());
    }

    private static void log(String op, BigDecimal bal) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " " + op + " → Balance: ₹" + bal);
    }
    private static void sleep(long ms) { try { Thread.sleep(ms); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {} }
}
```

---

## 10) Quick practice (do these now)

1. **Switch** from `synchronized` to `ReentrantLock` with `tryLock(100ms)` in `withdraw()`. Log a friendly “System busy, please retry.”
2. Add **metrics** using `LongAdder` for `totalDeposits` and `totalWithdrawals`.
3. Implement a **transfer** between two accounts with **global lock ordering** to avoid deadlock.
4. Add a **read-heavy** `getStatement()` using `ReadWriteLock` (fake returning a string or snapshot).
